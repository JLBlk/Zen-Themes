# Zen Themes

A personal collection of my CSS Themes 🎨 for the [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/).

(This repo probably won't get any new changes in the future. However, everyone's welcome to fork the repo/create a new one and make changes and all as well as submiting these changes to the official Zen Mods repo, no need to ask me or create a pr here 👍)

## Currently there is 1 Mod available to be installed through [Zen's website](https://zen-browser.app/mods):
  - [**SuperPins**](https://zen-browser.app/mods/ad97bb70-0066-4e42-9b5f-173a5e42c6fc)

  - **SuperGradient** (Removed, due to native implementation of gradients in Zen)
